# Jonathan Jacob Koshy

Hi there! I'm Jonathan, an Electrical Engineering student at the University of Waterloo, I am passionate about AI and hardware, embedded systems, and so much more. I love prototyping, debugging, and exploring how code and circuits come together to solve real problems.

## 🔧 Projects

### 🎮 STM32 Media Control & Activity Tracker
A handheld embedded system with a touchscreen interface — kind of like a mini Steam Deck!  
Built using an **STM32 NUCLEO-F401RE** and a **3.5" capacitive touch display** (ST7796S + FT6336U)  

- 🖥️ Touchscreen UI powered by **LVGL**
- 🎵 USB HID functionality to control media playback (play, pause, volume, etc.)
-  Tracks system activity, logs usage, and displays stats
-  Uses USB-C for power and communication
-  Fully designed enclosure + hardware integration

This project is a deep dive into **embedded C, STM32 HAL drivers, touch interface programming**, and system design.
### 🧠 SignToLearn
An AI-powered ASL learning app inspired by Duolingo  
Built using **Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, Flask, React**  
Real-time hand sign translation powered by Mediapipe

### 🗳️ FaceAuthVote
A secure face-authenticated voting system using blockchain principles  
Implemented **face recognition** for identity confirmation and vote integrity  
Custom user roles, profile protection, and digital ID management

### ❤️ Embedded Heartbeat Tracker
An STM32-based embedded system to measure and display heart rate using a **MAX3012 sensor**  
Features OLED screen integration, signal filtering, and real-time data display
