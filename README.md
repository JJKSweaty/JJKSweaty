## About Me

I design, build, and validate embedded systems that integrate firmware, sensors, and real-time control.  
My work focuses on low-level drivers, RTOS task pipelines, communication protocols, and hardware/software integration under tight timing and memory constraints.

## Edge Computing and On-Device Perception

I’m actively exploring edge computing for real-time perception and control, with a focus on running vision workloads close to the hardware to reduce latency and system complexity.

My current work involves prototyping perception pipelines on a Raspberry Pi 5 paired with a Hailo-8 AI accelerator, evaluating how on-device inference can be integrated with embedded control systems. This includes benchmarking inference latency, exploring model deployment constraints, and designing clean interfaces between perception, decision-making, and real-time firmware running on microcontrollers.

This work aligns with my interest in building embedded systems that combine sensing, computation, and actuation without relying on cloud dependencies.
